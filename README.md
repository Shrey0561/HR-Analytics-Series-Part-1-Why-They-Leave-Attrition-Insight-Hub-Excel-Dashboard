# HR Analytics- The Exit Equation: Understanding Attrition with Excel Dashboard
This project is the first installment in a two-part HR analytics series. While Part 2- *The Loyalty Blueprint* focuses on employee retention, this first phase examines the underlying causes of attrition using descriptive analytics in Excel.

## TL;DR
- **Goal**: Identify patterns and drivers of employee attrition using HR data
- **Tools**: Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, Dashboard Design)
- **Approach**: Segmented employees by department, role, experience, and satisfaction to uncover churn drivers
- **Outcome**: Found key pain points in Sales & Overtime employees and made strategic retention suggestions

## Overview
Utilizing a synthetic HR dataset of 1,470 employees, this analysis identifies key attrition drivers across departments, roles, and demographic groups using Excel-based modeling.

## Key Questions Answered 
 * What are the highest-attrition departments and job roles?
 * Are there demographic or workload patterns linked to exits?
 * How do satisfaction, income, and experience impact turnover?
 * Which employee cohorts are most at risk of leaving?

## Dashboard Preview Section
The dashboard below summarizes key attrition metrics, including department-level churn, job role risks, and satisfaction breakdowns. This was built using Excel, enabling quick diagnosis of high-risk segments.

## KPIs Tracked
 * **Total Attrition Rate**: 16.12%
 * **Fresh Hire Attrition**: 34.88%
 * **Department with Highest Attrition**: Sales (20.63%)
 * **Job Role with Highest Attrition**: Sales Representative (39.76%) 

## Business Insights & Strategic Recommendations
## Departmental Trends
The Sales department had the highest attrition at 20.63%, followed by Human Resources (19.05%).

*Recommendation: Audit job expectations and workload in high-turnover departments to reduce exit risk.*

## Role-Specific Breakdown
Sales Representatives had an attrition rate of 39.76%, nearly 4x the company average. Research Directors had the lowest at 2.5%.

*Observation: Entry-level or quota-driven roles may need better support systems or incentive realignment.*

## Gender-Based Patterns
Male attrition: **17.01%** | Female attrition: **14.80%**

*Recommendation: Examine role distribution and promotion equity to identify if career pathways differ by gender.*

## Overtime & Burnout
Employees who worked overtime had **30.53%** attrition vs **10.44%** for those who didn't. 

*Recommendation: Monitor overtime trends and introduce burnout prevention strategies in high-pressure roles.*

## Compensation & Retention 
Employees in lower income bands faced **28.61% attrition**.

*Recommendation: Strengthen pay transparency and progression frameworks to retain lower-band talent.*

## Tenure & Retention 
Fresh hires (0-1 yrs): **34.88%** attrition vs **12.91%** for 5+ year employees.

*Recommendation: Prioritize onboarding quality and engagement touchpoints in the first 6 months.*

## Satisfaction Metrics
Low scores in **Work-Life Balance (31.25% attrition) and **Job Satisfaction** (22.84%) directly correlated with exits.

*Recommendation: Use pulse surveys to catch early dissatisfaction and implement proactive interventions.*

## Tools Used
* Microsoft Excel
  > Pivot Tables Dashboard Design
* MySQL
  > Though this dashboard was built in Excel, a SQL-based version is included in Part 2 to ensure scalability across tools.

## What I'd Explore Next
If this were a real consulting engagement:
 * Add *exit interview data* to capture qualitative reasons for leaving
 * Analyze *time-based patterns* in attrition (e.g., seasonality, post-promotion exits)
 * Integrate *employee engagement surveys* to enrich predictive signals

## What This Project Demonstrates
 - My ability to derive strategic insights from operational HR data
 - Skill in building clear, functional dashboards in Excel
 - A strong grasp of the business impact behind attrition metrics
 - End-to-end thinking from data cleaning to presentation
