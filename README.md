 > Self-initiated project to practice HR analytics and Excel dashboarding skills.

## TL;DR
**Problem**: **16% of employees were leaving,** driving up costs and operational risks; the reasons were unclear.

 * **Key drivers**: Low work-life balance, poor job satisfaction, lower income bands, fresh hires
 * **Actionable takeaway**: Implement targeted onboarding, compensation adjustments, burnout prevention, and role support expected to reduce early exits.

## Overview
This analysis leverages a **synthetic HR dataset of 1,470 employees** to uncover the **key drivers of attrition** across departments, roles, and demographics. Using **Excel-based modeling,** it turns raw HR data into **actionable insights** that help HR teams **spot trends, reduce turnover, and make smarter strategic decisions.**

## Key Questions Answered 
 * Which departments and roles experience the **highest attrition**?
 * Are there **demographic or workload patterns** linked to exits?
 * How do **satisfaction, income, and tenure** influence turnover?
 * Which employee cohorts are at **greatest risk of leaving**?

## KPIs Tracked
 * **Total Attrition Rate**: 16.12%
 * **Fresh Hire Attrition (0-1 year)**: 34.88%
 * **Highest Attrition Department**: Sales (20.63%)
 * **Highest Attrition Role**: Sales Representative (39.76%) 

## Business Insights & Strategic Recommendations
## Departmental Trends
